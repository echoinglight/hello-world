# hello-world
following the tutorial as a new github user :)

I'm Echo! 24yo, she/he/they pronouns, USA. I picked up a collection of ebooks about linux and programming a couple months ago (thanks, HumbleBundle!) and have been hooked on learning how to code from that moment onward. 
I'm an anthropology major and unofficially linguistics minor - currently been on a break from university while I've been moved and raised my two puppies up into working service dogs for myself and my partner's invisible disabilities. I love gaming, writing, pens under .2mm, and anything lemon-scented. 
I hope that learning programming will open doors to new skills, people, and opportunities, add brainwork and productivity into the hobbies I already know love, allow me to share what I know and what I'm passionate about in a fun and interesting way, and possibly even give me a chance to work from home!
